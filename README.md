# Multicore-Processor

This repository highlights the workflow and methodology of the project, and it also contains the SystemVerilog and machine code. 
Changes will be made throughout the semester on a daily basis using the input coming from the supervisor and the simulation results.
In order to keep the design tidy, I organised the repository in various branches, for the final design all the practical work will be included in the master branch.
