To develop the 32 bit dual-core MIPS processor in the Vivado environment I will follow this schedule:

- Single cycle MIPS processor containing all the basic elements.
- Pipeline the single cycle processor into multiple stages.
- Simulation of the basic functionalities, i.e. stage to stage analysis.
- Complete core development including caches.
- Testing the core with serial assembly programs.
- Addition of another core based on the same pipelined design.
- Implementing the coherency protocol and the shared memory mechanism.
- Testing the core with parallel assembly programs.

Any challenges and exceptions will be mentioned in the logbooks.
